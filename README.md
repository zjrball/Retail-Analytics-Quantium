## Project Overview

Goal: To analyze customer transaction data and evaluate the financial impact of new store layouts for the Category Manager.

This project simulates a real-world engagement where I act as a data analyst helping a retailer optimize their sales strategy. It moves from initial data cleaning to statistical experimentation (A/B testing) and finally to commercial reporting.

## Project Roadmap

I am currently working through the following three distinct modules:

#### Task 1: Data Preparation & Customer Analytics

[x] Data Cleaning: Identifying inconsistencies in transaction records.

[x] Segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

[x] Visualization: identifying initial sales drivers and trends.

#### Task 2: Experimentation (Uplift Testing)

[ ] Benchmark Selection: Choosing control stores that match trial stores.

[ ] Statistical Analysis: Comparing sales performance between Trial and Control groups.

[ ] Impact Assessment: Calculating the specific revenue uplift from the new layout.

#### Task 3: Commercial Application

[ ] Reporting: Structuring findings using the "Pyramid Principle".

[ ] Recommendations: Translating data into actionable business advice for the Category Manager.

## Tools & Skills

## Data Privacy

This project uses a simulated dataset provided by the virtual internship program. No actual proprietary client data is included.

## Acknowledgement

This project was made with the help of Quantium's virtual internship in Forage, and added to my portfolio to demonstrate full-cycle analytics skills using R. Thank you to Quantium for this fantastic learning opportunity.
